# Chapter One
## about pills who rape

I write to forget; fiery anuses.

let person one be a banker; let person two be not a banker; they meet on a bus station near the office of the first person. It's late and raining.

This chapter is going to be about how and why they meet. It will be sad. One will bully the other, constantly saying that the latter is poor and generally unsuccessful. Pretty standart, nothing impressive will happen. The second person will tell the banker that the banker is not happy once near the end. But the banker will counter that saying there is no happiness.
