# Chapter One
## about pills who rape

I write to forget; fiery anuses.

short plan for the chapter

let person one be a banker; let person two be not a banker; they meet on a bus station near the office of the first person. It's late and raining.

This chapter is going to be about how and why they meet. i want the general mood of the chapter to be sad; the characters have not lived to the 'fullest'?. One will bully the other, constantly saying that the latter is poor and generally unsuccessful. Pretty standart stuff, nothing impressive will happen. The second person will tell the banker that he is sure that the banker does not feel fulfillment, like 'I'm sure, you don't feel fulfillment, mate.' Don't know yet how the banker will respond. He will probably laugh and shake his head


what the fuck am i doing

killing some time, duh
