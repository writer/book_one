# Chapter One
## about pills who rape

I write to forget; fiery anuses.

short plan for the chapter

let person one be a banker; let person two be not a banker; they meet on a bus station near the office of the first person. It's late and raining.

This chapter is going to be about how and why they meet. i want the general mood of the chapter to be sad; the characters have not lived to the 'fullest', have not been keeping it 'real'?. One bullies the other, constantly saying that not-a-banker is poor and unsuccessful and unambitious. nothing impressive happens. and then! the second person tells the banker that he (the-banker-dude) does not feel fulfillment, like 'I'm sure, mate, you don't feel fulfillment, mate. Of that I'ma sure.' Don't know yet how the banker responds.
